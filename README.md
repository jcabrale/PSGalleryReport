# PSGallery Latest

This repository contains markdown reports for the PowerShell Gallery. The hope is that it will be easier for you to find modules that will make your work easier. The plan is to update the reports on a regular basis and push them to this repository.

Feel free to use the Discussion section to talk about specific modules. If you think there should be another type of report, feel free to submit a Feature Request in the Issues section of this repository.
